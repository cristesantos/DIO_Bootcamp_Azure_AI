## Key Concepts

- **Cloud Computing:** Storage, data processing, software, and networking are provided over the internet instead of being hosted on local company servers. Resources can be consumed on demand, meaning users are only charged for what they use. This enables scalability, flexibility, agility, and remote access.

- **Scalability:** The ability to adjust resources to meet changing (higher or lower) demand. Users pay only for what they consume.

- **Reliability:** Cloud infrastructure is distributed across multiple regions, so if one fails, others can maintain availability.

- **Predictability:** Trust in the cloud environment to use optimal resources that support the growth and advancement of user technology.

- **Security:** Offers a variety of tools and services to ensure data protection.

- **Governance:** Includes internal auditing features that notify users of non-compliance and provide tools to mitigate risks.

- **Manageability:** Users have control over which resources they use and how they are configured.

- **SLA (Service Level Agreement):** A commitment by the cloud provider guaranteeing a certain level of service availability.

- **Infrastructure Models:** On-Premises, Cloud, and Hybrid
  - **On-Premises (local):** Physical infrastructure (e.g., data centers) is hosted within the company. Offers more customization and control, but it's expensive and requires physical space.
  - **Cloud (remote):** Infrastructure is hosted off-site and maintained by providers (e.g., Azure, AWS). It is more cost-effective, scalable, and flexible, but depends on internet connectivity.
  - **Hybrid:** A combination of on-premises and cloud infrastructure. Offers greater flexibility by allowing companies to choose the best storage location (local or remote) based on their needs. However, it can be more complex to manage.
